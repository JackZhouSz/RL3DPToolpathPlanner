# RL-based-planner-for-3D-printing-toolpath

Supplementary material for Reinforcement Learning Based Planner for 3D Printing Toolpath:

The input txt file format:

Number of nodes in the input graph:

Three-dimensional coordinates of nodes: X Y Z.

Number of edges in the input graph:

The corresponding node indexes on each edge: head tail.

The output txt file format:

Index of nodes in print order: first node, second node, ... , final node.

The output_with_norm txt file format:

Three-dimensional coordinates of nodes: X Y Z , and printing normal: nx ny nz.

The code is coming soon.
